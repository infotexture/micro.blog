			 <p>ðŸ¤© I love my clients. Last month I ran a #ContentOperations workshop for a company in Norway, where we focused on improving #UXwriting and #ContentDesign processes.</p>
<p>We started with an intro for stakeholders to set the stage, followed by focus sessions for developers, designers, and writers. In each session, we explored how each role can help streamline UI copy workflows and work better together.</p>
<p>They mocked up an album cover to pitch the event, and plastered the office with posters. â€” There was even a disco ball. ðŸª©</p>
<p>I donâ€™t expect this level of enthusiasm from everyone, but if youâ€™re still copying and pasting strings in issue comments, or shuffling spreadsheets and copy docs to track your UI text, get in touch.</p>
<p>Iâ€™d be happy to teach your team a few new moves â€” and I promise not to dance. ðŸ•º</p>
